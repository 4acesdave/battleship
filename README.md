Basic Battleship game to be played in the Command Prompt
This was my final project in my Intro to C++ class, to make a basic Battleship game that can be played in the terminal.
You enter the coordinates of the "water" (represented by ~s) you wish to "fire" upon, then the game will tell you if it is a hit.
You can enter Q at any point to quit, or play until you win.
It could use some tightening when it comes to cleaning up the part that loads a ton of 1's and 0's beforehand, as well as the fact that it takes a couple of runs 
before the game will play properly at times.
